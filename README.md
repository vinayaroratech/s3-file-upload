# s3-file-upload
Handling file uploads in aws s3 with nodejs, expres, multer, lambda, api-gateway

We will see how we can upload files or images to the server using Node.js. Here we are going to use Visual Studio for our development and the following NPM packages for our easy development:

- Express
- Multer
- Body-parser

# Express
As per the Express Team, Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features that you know and love. You can always learn more about Express Package here.

# Multer
Multer is a Node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files. It is written on top of busboy for maximum efficiency. You can find out more about the multer package here.
